          <p>
            When it comes to decor, a well-balanced approach to color, texture,
            and furniture can elevate the design of any space. Start with a
            neutral color scheme for large surfaces like walls and floors, using
            shades of white, beige, or soft gray as a base.

            It involves carefully planning the placement of furniture, decor,
            and other elements to optimize the flow of the room while
            maintaining balance and harmony. Start by considering the room’s
            focal points, such as a fireplace, large window, or statement piece
